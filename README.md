===================

This repository was the source for the "Is It Snowing In Berlin" single-purpose website.
As I no longer live in Berlin, and was just maintaining the site for my own use before,
I decided to archive this repository and take down the site, so I don't have potential
security issues. Additionally, I would need to change data sources and keep paying for
a ".de" domain which isn't as fun when you don't live there.

I'll likely be reviving this project in the future under a different repository, so
stay tuned to my github profile: https://github.com/jerr0328
